The project involves developing a game that utilizes the DE1-SoC board's VGA output, switches, and an accelerometer. 
The central theme of the game is guiding a ball through a maze. Players will control the movement of the ball by physically tilting the board, taking advantage of the x-axis and y-axis readings from the accelerometer. 
The VGA output will be used to display the maze and the ball's position, providing a visual interface for the player. 
The switches on the DE1-SoC board will be used for additional controls or game settings, such as changing the colors or presicion of the accelerometer.
